# MetaLine

MetaLine is intended as a companion tool to help translators create their own translation memories (TMs) from already translated texts. Translation memories can be exported into a TMX file that can be used with other CAT tools.
This project is still under active development so do not expect a finished and polished application. There are some missing features and I'm currently working on extending the input formats, support SRX segmentation rules, improve the user experience and so forth…

## Trivia

MetaLine is part of a greater project of open source translation tools, e.g. MetaTerm for terminology management. The "meta-" prefix comes from the Greek verb μεταφράζω meaning "to translate".
